## Permissions

### Android
The app requires the following permissions in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:
- `READ_CONTACTS` - To access contacts
- `SEND_SMS` - To send SMS messages

### iOS
The app requires the following permissions in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:
- `NSContactsUsageDescription` - To access contacts
- Note: iOS doesn't allow direct SMS sending, so the app opens the native Messages app

## How to Use

2. **Type your message** - Enter the SMS text in the message field
3. **Select contacts** - Choose individual contacts or use "Select All"
4. **Send SMS**:
   - **Android**: Tap "Send SMS" to send directly
   - **iOS**: Tap "Open Messages" to open Messages app (manual send required)
